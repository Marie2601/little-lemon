        <p className="Description-About">Two Italian brothers, Adrian and Mario, grew up in the heart of Chicago, raised on their Nonnaâ€™s recipes and the rich traditions of their heritage. With a deep love for food and community, they opened Little Lemon, a cozy neighborhood restaurant that brings a fresh twist to classic Italian cuisine. Known for its warm atmosphere and bold, citrus-inspired flavors, Little Lemon quickly became a local favorite.</p>
